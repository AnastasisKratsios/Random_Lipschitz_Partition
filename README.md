# # Random Lipschitz Partition

Given a positive integer $N$ and a real-number, this codes partitions the space into N random subsets such that:

 - Minimum probability that two nearby data-points are in different partitions,
 - Each has the same number of datapoints on average.
 
Can be used in Architopes (see: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14378) to make the regression algorithm semi-supervised.
